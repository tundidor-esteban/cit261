<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>
  I feel a little lost. I was expecting a completely different course. Since the title is "Mobile Application Development", I was expecting something related with Android or Objective-C/Swift. My bad, I never read the course description when I chose the class. It is ok because Javascript is a modern language too, but since I am experienced in it I will try to go deeper. This course have a lot of evidence to produce. 
</p>
  <p>Since I am not English-native, I am really worried about the language barrier. It will be definitely not funny if I fail this class by my lack of English, instead of my knowledge of JavaScript.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
  Scheduling with my team looks very complex, we are many hours ahead (4 and 5). I don't feel a real concern of my classmates to fulfill the class requirements. All of them fails to our first appointment. Finally I met Mike S. and we complete the requirements.
</p>
<p>
  I started to review the topics, after 20 years of programming experience variables, parameters, conditionals, etc didn't looks something that I will have the opportunity to go deeper. I started this site and I will try to make it funny, pretty and challenging with only JS and CSS, even when make the things pretty are not my bigger strength.
</p>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>
  We finnaly have our first meeting with a lesson, actually we cover 3 topics. The last musketeer is still missing (Micheal M.). We are D'Artagnan and the two musketeers by now. It was funny, and I feel very happy because the Zoom automatic transcript function understand me a 75% of my interventions. It looks like my English pronunciation is not so terrible. 
</p>
<p>
  I have started to complete more about evidence, no new knowledge, but trying to complete the work.
</p>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
<p>
  We meet again with Mike S. and Brent (Michael M. is still missing). We covered this week topics based in the plan, I presented instead of Michael M. presenting about "AJAX". Reading the topics trying to find or remember some tips about the topics. 
</p>
<h3>Week 5</h3>
<p>
  This week I read and practice about local storage. Even when LS was a known topic, was great to practice a little more because I used it long time ago. We meet again with Mike S. and Brent (Michael M. is still missing). We covered this week topics based in the plan. I presented about "CSS3 Using JavaScript"
</p>
<h3>Week 6</h3>
<p>
  This week we meet again with Mike Short (Brent and Michael M. were missing). We discussed about some of the topics. I was studing about transitions, animations and transformations. I was able to go deeper so I learn some interesting stuff. This was the funniest week of this course. I also finished the fluency site. 
</p>
<h3>Week 7</h3>
<p>
  This week we meet again with Mike Short and Brent (Michael M. was missing, we suppose he dropped the class). We discussed about JS inheritance, variables, loops, and also CSS animations. I remade some examples in particular the AJAX one. Now I am using an API named spoonacular who allows you to find ingredients and dishes. I am waiting for additional feedback and the next week I will try to start with the final project.
</p>
<h3>Week 8</h3>
<p>
This week we meet again with Mike Short and Brent and discussed about JSON, Ajax and Local Storage. I started a draft of the final project but I am not sure about the scope. 
</p>
<h3>Week 9</h3>
<p>
  This week we meet again with Mike Short and Brent and discussed about DOM and CSS Transitions. I fixed some missing examples, learn about Mobile events (touch and orientation) also I continued with the basics of the final project.
</p>
<h3>Week 10</h3>
<p>
  We meet with Mike S. and Brent, we share our implementations about CSS Transformations and Animations, also we talk about events and I shared what I learn the last week about mobile events. I finally decided my final project idea and shared with the teacher, I am waiting now for his feedback to start the implementation. I also complete the professional document.
</p>
<h3>Week 11</h3>
<p>
  Since it is optional, we decided to not meet. We are waiting for grades and I am continuing working on my final project. I learn about CSS Grid, and column display, it is very useful. I am really close to finsh it & checking to cover all the topics.
