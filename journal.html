<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>
  I feel a little lost. I was expecting a completely different course. Since the title is "Mobile Application Development", I was expecting something related with Android or Objective-C/Swift. My bad, I never read the course description when I chose the class. It is ok because Javascript is a modern language too, but since I am experienced in it I will try to go deeper. This course have a lot of evidence to produce. 
</p>
  <p>Since I am not English-native, I am really worried about the language barrier. It will be definitely not funny if I fail this class by my lack of English, instead of my lack of knowledge of JavaScript.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
  Scheduling with my team looks very complex, we are many hours ahead (4 and 5). I don't feel a real concern of my classmates to fulfill the class requirements. All of them fails to our first appointment. Finally I met Mike S. and we complete the requirements.
</p>
<p>
  I started to review the topics, after 20 years of programming experience variables, parameters, conditionals, etc didn't looks something that I will have the opportunity to go deeper. I started this site and I will try to make it funny, pretty and challenging with only JS and CSS, even when make the things pretty are not my bigger strength.
</p>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>
  We finnaly have our first meeting with a lesson, actually we cover 3 topics. The last musketeer is still missing (Micheal M.). We are D'Artagnan and the two musketeers by now. It was funny, and I feel very happy because the Zoom automatic transcript function understand me a 75% of my interventions. It looks like my English pronunciation is not so terrible.
